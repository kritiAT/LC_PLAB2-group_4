## Programming Project 03 - Likelihood Protein Identification via k-mer Genetic Sequence Assembly


In this project, you will develop a pipeline for assembling fixed-length DNA strand reads into a complete
sequence and predict which protein the completed strand may represent.
Aims
1. Perform de novo sequence assembly on a set of fixed-length DNA strands (k-mers)
2. Transcribe and translate the assembled DNA sequence
3. Predict which protein the assembled DNA strand may represent
4. Create a frontend which allows one to upload a series of DNA strand reads and obtain a list protein predictions

# Protein Identification via k-mer Genetic Sequence Assembly

### Take a list of DNA strands as inputs, and perform multiple sequence alignment to reconstruct the genetic sequence.
### The compiled genetic sequence is then transcribed to its corresponding mRNA sequence.ORFs are then identified  to predict possible amino acid sequences.
### The generated amino acid sequences are then aligned against a protein database using blast server. 
### Finally, the list of possible proteins is returned.
